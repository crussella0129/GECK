# GECK_Macro.md
## Protocol Version: 1.0

---

### **Garden of Eden Creation Kit - Overall Structure**
- LLM_init.md # Intital instructions, added to the repository before LLM_GECK is created. See LLM_init.md Template Below.
- LLM_GECK (Folder)
   - LLM_log.md # Append-only File containing a ledger with a timestamp of each action taken, a summary of understood goals, and a breif description of next steps. Acts as Long Term Memory for the Project. See LLM_Log.md Template Below. 
   - LLM_ckls.md # Editable File that acts as a "current tasks" checklist (acts like RAM, compared to the Long Term Memory of LLM_log.md).
   - LLM_dpmp.md # File that records any notable or otherwise unrecorded dependencies of any files or folders added throughout the project.
   - LLM_env.md # File that records the Hw/Fw/Sw environment being developed on, as well as what environment the end product is expected to run on.


## PHASE 0: INITIALIZATION (Run Once Per Project - Skip to "Phase 1" if LLM_GECK Folder Exists)

### Step 0.0 — Create Repository on Github and Establish Local Directory

- Human or LLM Agent Instructions:
   - Ensure SSH Keys for Local System are shared with Github (One Time).
   - Create GitHub Repo for project and record the URL.
   - Create target directory for project and record path.
   - Create LLM_init.md either in the Target Directory (and push to Git Repo), or directly in the GitHub Repo via a browser, according to the template attached at the end of this document.

### Step 0.1 — Instruct Agent to Clone Repository and Read LLM_init.md
```
Clone the repo at [REPO_URL] to local directory [TARGET_DIR]. Read LLM_Init.md in full. Do not execute yet.
```
### Step 0.2 — LLM_GECK Folder Creation, GenSys "Memory Document" Creation, Environment Snapshot, and Consolidation of LLM_init.md
- After cloning and reading LLM_Init.md, create the `LLM_GECK` Folder and create the following files within the folder:
   - `LLM_log.md`
      - Add Entry #0 to `LLM_log.md` in the format of the `LLM_log.md` template at the end of this document:
         - Timestamp
         - Summary: "Project initialized. Instructions parsed."
         - Understood Goals: [bullet list of what you understood]
         - Ambiguities/Questions: [anything unclear—ASK before assuming]
         - Proposed Tasks: [what tasks will be added to `LLM_ckls.md` as the first tasks to handle]
   - `LLM_ckls`
      - Add the proposed tasks 
  
   - `LLM_env.md` with:
      - Python version (`python --version`)
      - Node version if applicable (`node --version`)
      - OS and shell (`uname -a` or equivalent)
      - Package manager state (`pip list` or `pip freeze > requirements_snapshot.txt`)
      - Any `.env` variables that are non-secret (document their *existence*, not values)
      - Desired system compatibility, by indicating what environments this application _should_ run on to consider when developing (Eg. Windows 11, MacOS, Arch, Fedora, Debian, iOS, etc...). *LLM will pull this instruction from LLM_Init.md*
   

### Step 0.3 — Create Initial Log and Checklist Entry
- Add Entry #0 to `LLM_log.md` in the format of the `LLM_log.md` template at the end of this document:
   - Timestamp
   - Summary: "Project initialized. Instructions parsed."
   - Understood Goals: [bullet list of what you understood]
   - Ambiguities/Questions: [anything unclear—ASK before assuming]
   - Proposed First Action: [what you plan to do in Phase 1]

**STOP. Wait for human confirmation before proceeding.**

---

## PHASE 1: EXECUTION LOOP (Repeat Until Done)

### Step 1.1 — Read Current State
```
Read the LAST 3 entries of LLM_Log.md and the SUCCESS CRITERIA section of LLM_Initial_Instructions.md
```

### Step 1.2 — Plan This Turn
- Before writing ANY code:
   1. State what you're about to do (1-2 short paragraphs)
   2. State the dependencies of any files you plan to work on (after searching those dependencies) and explain how your changes will not create dependency errors. 
   3. State what success looks like for THIS turn
   4. State any assumptions you're making
   

### Step 1.3 — Execute
Do the work. Do not Commit or Push yet.

### Step 1.4 — Log Entry
Add new entry to `LLM_Log.md`:
```markdown
---
## Entry #[N] — [ISO Timestamp]

### Actions Taken
- [Bullet list of what you did]

### Files Modified
- `path/to/file.py` — [one-line description of change]

### Findings
- [Anything notable: bugs found, design decisions, surprises]

### Issues/Blockers
- [Problems encountered, with severity: MINOR | MAJOR | BLOCKER]

### Checkpoint
- [ ] Working state: YES / NO / PARTIAL
- [ ] Tests passing: YES / NO / N/A
- [ ] Safe to continue: YES / WAIT FOR HUMAN

### Next Steps
1. [Specific next action]
2. [Contingency if #1 fails]

### Questions for Human (if any)
- [Decision points that need human input]
```

### Step 1.5 — Human Review Point
If `Safe to continue: WAIT FOR HUMAN`, STOP and await input.
Otherwise, return to Step 1.1.

---

## PHASE 2: COMPLETION

When SUCCESS CRITERIA from `LLM_init.md` are met:

1. Add final log entry with:
   - Summary of all major changes
   - Known limitations or technical debt
   - Suggested future improvements

2. Generate `CHANGELOG.md` entry if appropriate

3. State: **"PROJECT GOALS ACHIEVED. Ready for human review."**

---

## ROLLBACK PROTOCOL

If a turn causes regression:
```
Identify the last known-good Entry # from LLM_Log.md.
State what broke and why.
Propose rollback strategy (git revert, manual fix, etc.)
Wait for human approval before reverting.
```

---

## DECISION FORK PROTOCOL

When facing a non-obvious choice (library selection, architecture pattern, etc.):
1. Document the fork in log entry
2. List options with pros/cons (max 3 options)
3. State your recommendation with reasoning
4. Mark `Safe to continue: WAIT FOR HUMAN`

# LLM Checklist — [Project Name]

*Append Only - DO NOT edit existing entries. Post corrections in further entries if needed, referecing the affected entry number and section.
*If `LLM_GECK` Folder AND `LLM_ckls.md` file exist, this is a subseqent turn and the next 'unstarted task' (dillineated with []) should be completed, unless a different task is specified.*

## Entry #[Number] — Timestamp: [Date and Time]

### Understood Scope and Goals
- First Turn: Pull and summarize "### GOAL" from LLM_init.md in 1-2 paragraphs at most, but as concisely as possible. 
- Every Subsequent Turn:  Observe the "### Understood Goals" from the previous LLM_log.md entry number as well as the instructions you received this turn and restate the newly understood scope and goals.
   - Scope and Goals should remain *exactly the same* across turns unless explicit instructions were received that changed the Scope and Goals.
   - Suggestions for improvements can be made later in the 

### Checklist Snapshot (Complete at *Beginning of Turn*)
- First Turn: "First Turn - No Assigned Tasks"
- Every Subsequent Turn: Take a snapshot of the checklist in LLM_ckls.md (without the document headings) and copy it here at the *beginning* of the turn. 

### Successful Actions Taken
- First Turn: "LLM_init.md file read and project initialized"
- Every Subsequent turn: List successfully completed tasks from the checklist (all of which would be listed in the checklist snapshot above) with a brief 1-2 sentance summary of what was done. These tasks would be given a  

### Actions Delayed due to Dependency or Decision Making
- First Turn: This space should be left blank as there are no delayed actions on the first turn. 
- Every Subsequent Turn: List what actions were delayed due to a Dependency or a Design Decicision needing to be made. Add 

### Failed Actions
- First Turn: "First Turn - No Failed Tasks"
- Every Subsequent Turn: 

### New Checklist (Complete at *End of Turn*)
- First Turn: The first tasks generated and added to the checklist. All should be incomplete.
- Every Subsequent Turn: *AT THE END OF THE TURN*, read LLM_ckls.md and categorize each action taken according to the sections above (by using the [],[X], [DEP], [DSN], and [Failed] status indicators, which are updated as each task is operated on) and log accordingly in this entry of LLM_Log.md.
   - The new checklist should have any tasks derived from a Dependency delay, any remaining design decisions that still need to be made or implemented, as well as "next steps" in the build process to accomplish the "### Understood Scope and Goals", combined into a new coherent checklist of tasks.

### Suggested Improvements (DO NOT use to formulate LLM checklist tasks, only use to record suggestions)
- First Turn and Every Subsequent Turn: Identify points of improvement and make suggestions.
