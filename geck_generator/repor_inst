# Repor - AI Reaper for Repos (Build Instructions)

## GECK Repor will be a feature (and a sub menu) within the GECK generator, allowing for the assessement and procurement of code from Git Repositories.

### Intended Input Workflow:
	1. The user will be able to "browse" the computer for a working directory that they intend to optimize features for.
		- Should be just like the "Browse button" menu in the current GECK generator, which will become a submenu called "GECK Bootstrapper")
	2. The user will be able to add a list of GitHub, GitLab, or other Git Repo hosting URLs and .gits that an AI "Explore Agent" will then read the code in the repos.
		- this should be like the "success criteria" in the GECK generator (now GECK Bootstrapper) that allows for adding strings to a list with an add and remove button.
	3. There should be an "Additional Goals" section after that where the user can make specific instructions of what to look for (or how to look) to find potential improvements.
		- this should be the same format as the 'success criteria' menu mentioned before.
		- there could also be a dropdown for preset exploration profiles that create preset 'sets' of exploration goals. Create what profiles would be most useful. Custom/No Profile should also be an option.
	4. "Create GECK Repor Agent Instructions" button shouldhe selected once these things are all filled out (the additional goals are optional and dont need to be filled out)

### Intended Output

	1. Heading
		- Project Name
		- Working directory name
		- GECK Folder name (which is standardized so it shoukd be deducible from the working directory name)
		- Project Git Repo URL or .git (to prevent wasting tokens re-searching the target repo)
